Part 3 Questions

41. I see a list of notes and their durations. I would know how to play them on a piano if I
    knew what the duration meant (probably measures)
43. Yes
45. I don't know
55. Didn't predict anything since I didn't know what to expect
    but the first step printed "Instrument number: 0" in the terminal
    and the second and third steps printed an empty line
56. What do you want me to write? I know how conditionals work
58. Step Into shows what's being called in every line of code, very useful
    if you don't understand what's not working
